# user-authentication-site-2.0
Web app that requires users to sign in locally or through Facebook/Google

All locally created users are authenticated by passport and stored in the local DB.

All users that sign up with google or facebook only have their id's stored in the Database. This adds an extra layer of security because their passwords are not stored in our DB, and are protected by tech giants.

Functionality

The main point of the site is for users that have signed in to upload their secrets. Their secrets are then displayed on the home screen anonymously and can be viewed by anyone. Each user can post 1 secret at a time. Sign in, Sign up and Sign out is supported.
